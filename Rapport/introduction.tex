\section{Introduction}

This is a lab called the Helicopter Lab. As the name indicates we are going to control a model of a helicopter in different ways. The system with its hardware is described in detail in \cite{_helicopter_2015}. A model of the helicopter with regulators is allready made for us. The objective is for us, the students, to find an optimal sequence of inputs that will steer the helicopter on the desired path. This will be done by formulating optimization problems, and solving them. We will solve them as discrete problems using MATLAB, wich mean that we first have to discretize our system. This input sequense we give to our system using Simulink/QuaRC. We will run our helicopters using the optimal input directly, and them compare the behaviour when we introduce feedback.

In this report we will be presenting our results in the same order that we obtained them, meaning we will have one section for each exercise in \cite{_helicopter_2015}, where the relevant math, code, plots, results, etc. will be added. The discussion will be done consecutively, with the exeption of one summarizing discution at the end of the report.
