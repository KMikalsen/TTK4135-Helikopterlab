\section{Introduction}

The intention of this lab assignment is to apply various optimisation-based control techniques to a physical model of a helicopter. The system with its hardware is described in detail in \cite{_helicopter_2015}. A mathematical model of the helicopter with pitch and elevation controllers is already made for us. Our objective is to find an optimal sequence of inputs that will steer the helicopter on the desired path. This will be done by formulating optimization problems, and solving them. We will solve them as discrete problems using MATLAB, which mean that we first have to discretise our system. We apply this input sequence to the system using Simulink/QuaRC. We then run the helicopter using the optimal input directly, and compare the behaviour to when we introduce feedback.

In this report we will be presenting our results in the same order that they were obtained, meaning we will have one section for each exercise in \cite{_helicopter_2015}, where the relevant mathematics, code, plots, results, and so on will be added. The discussion will be done alongside this, with the exception of one summarizing discussion at the end of the report.
