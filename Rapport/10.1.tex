\section{Repetition/introduction to Simulink/QuaRC (10.1)}

The first problem was intended as repetition for those that have completed the helicopter lab in the course TTK4115 Linear System Theory, and an introduction to Simulink/QuaRC for everyone else. All members of our group have completed TTK4115, so we didn't use much time on this problem. We ran the Simulink/QuaRC-program, and observed that the pre-made controllers were behaving fine. We changed the setpoints in real-time, and immediately got satisfying responses from the helicopter.
