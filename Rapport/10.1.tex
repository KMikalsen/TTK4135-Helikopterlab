\section{Repetition/introduction to Simulink/QuaRC (10.1)}

The first exercise in the exercise set was meant as a repetition for those that have completed the Helicopter lab in the course TTK4115 Linear System Theory, and a introduction to Simulink/QuaRC for the rest. In our group everyone have completed the lab from TTK4115, and we didn't use much time on this problem. We ran the Simulink/QuaRC-program, and observed that premade controllers were behaving fine. We changed the setpoints in real-time, and immediately got satisfying responses from the helicopter.
