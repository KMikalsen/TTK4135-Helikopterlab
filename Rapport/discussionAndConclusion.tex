\section{Discussion}
The purpose of this lab was to formulate a dynamic optimization problem, and solve this using MATLAB and Simulink, as well as seeing the results of control both with and without feedback.

First, this was done by using model-based optimization to provide the pitch and elevation controllers with an input $u$, before the model was improved by adding an LQR-control layer between the optimization layer and the basic control layer. 


\section{Conclusion}
We feel that it has been interesting to work on this lab, and that we have learnt a lot by doing it. Through a practical approach to implementing optimization algorithms, we have gained insight into how it might be to work as a control system engineer and some of the problems they encounter. 
We have also seen that using optimization algorithms when making a control system makes the system more precise, and is worth both the time and energy it takes to implement them. 

All in all we think this has been a successful exercise, and it has been both rewarding and educational.
