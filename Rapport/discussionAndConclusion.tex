\section{Discussion}
The purpose of this lab was to formulate a dynamic optimization problem, and solve this using \texttt{MATLAB} and Simulink, as well as seeing the results of control both with and without feedback.

First, this was done by using model-based optimization to provide the pitch and elevation controllers with an input $u$, before the model was improved by adding an LQR-control layer between the optimization layer and the basic control layer. 


\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion our group feels that it has been interesting to work on this lab, and that we have learnt a lot by doing it. By getting a practical approach to implementing optimization algorithms, we have gained insight into how it can be to work as control system engineers and some of the problems they have to solve. 
We have also seen that using optimization algorithms when making a control system makes the system more precise, and is both worth the time and energy it takes to implement them. 

All in all we think this has been a successful exercise, that has been both rewarding and educational.
